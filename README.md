# Deepfake IoT Detection

Lightweight CNN-based deepfake detector for IoT security.


# 🧠 Deepfake Facial Detection for IoT Biometric Security

This repository contains the full pipeline for a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to detect deepfake facial content, optimized for deployment in resource-constrained IoT environments such as Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano. The model is trained using public datasets and converted to TensorFlow Lite for real-time edge inference.

## 🚀 Project Objectives
- Develop an efficient CNN for deepfake detection under 2MB.
- Simulate real-world IoT camera conditions via video degradations.
- Deploy the model to edge-class devices and benchmark performance.
- Provide a reproducible demo pipeline from training to deployment.

## 🧪 Datasets Used

- **FaceForensics++** (Rössler et al., 2019)
- **Celeb-DF v2** (Li et al., 2020)
- **DeeperForensics-1.0** (Jiang et al., 2020)

All datasets were preprocessed to simulate IoT conditions such as compression, blur, and motion artifacts.
